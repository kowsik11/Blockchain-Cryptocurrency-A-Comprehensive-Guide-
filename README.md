# 🚀 Blockchain Overview

## 🔗 What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a **decentralized** system where a **distributed ledger** records transactions across multiple computers in a **secure** and **immutable** manner. 

### 🛡️ Cryptography - The Heart of Blockchain
Blockchain leverages **cryptographic hashing** to ensure security and immutability.

### 💰 Where is Blockchain Used?
- **Cryptocurrencies** (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- **Smart Contracts**
- **Secure Data Storage**

## 🌟 Key Features of Blockchain
✅ **Transparency**  
✅ **Immutability**  
✅ **Decentralization**  
✅ **Security**

## 📜 Smart Contracts
**Self-executing contracts** with predefined rules, directly written into code on the blockchain. 

## ⛓️ How Transactions Form Blocks?
1. Transactions are broadcasted to the network.
2. Miners **pick up unconfirmed transactions** and solve complex puzzles.
3. Miners **validate and add** transactions into a new block.
4. Block is **permanently added** to the blockchain.

## ⚖️ Consensus Algorithms
A mechanism used to achieve agreement across nodes in a distributed system. Ensures **consistency, accuracy, and validation**.

### 🔥 Types of Consensus Algorithms:
- **PoW (Proof of Work)** - Miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions.
- **PoS (Proof of Stake)** - Validates based on the amount of cryptocurrency staked.
- **DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake)** - Delegated nodes validate transactions.
- **PoI (Proof of Importance)** - Based on network activity and transaction importance.
- **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** - Ensures consensus as long as **⅔ of nodes are honest**.
- **PoET (Proof of Elapsed Time)** - Fair lottery system using **Intel SGX**.

## ⚒️ What is Mining in Cryptocurrencies?
The process of **validating transactions** and adding them to the blockchain while earning rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.

### 🏗️ Block Structure (Block Header)
📌 **Previous Block Hash**  
📌 **Timestamp**  
📌 **Nonce**  
📌 **Merkle Root**  
📌 **Version**  
📌 **Difficulty Target**

## 🔑 What is a Hash Function?
A cryptographic algorithm that **converts input data into a fixed-size string**, ensuring **security and immutability**.

## ⚡ How Does Blockchain Address Scalability Issues?
- **Sharding** 🔀
- **Layer 2 Protocols** 🏗️
- **Transition to PoS (Ethereum 2.0)** 🔄

## ⛽ What is the Role of Gas Fees in Ethereum?
Gas fees are **transaction fees** paid to miners for executing operations on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🚫 What is Double-Spending?
A risk where digital currency can be spent **more than once**, prevented by blockchain's **consensus mechanisms**.
