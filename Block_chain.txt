Block chain: Its a decentralized system, where distributed ledger records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and immutable manner.
where we used cryptography is heart of the blockchain. We used in crypto currencies. ledger: records keeping system that tracks.  << ---


What are the key features of blockchain?
Transparency, immutability, decentralization, and security.

cryptographic hashing and the linking of blocks, altering a block invalidates all subsequent blocks.

What are smart contracts?  << ---
Self-executing contracts with predefined rules directly written into code on the blockchain.

transactions from blocks
blocks are added to blockchain -> miners pick up unconfirmed transactions and solve complex puzzles to create a new block.
And then minors will decide which transactions to include.
then blocks are added permanently.

consensus algo: A mechanism used to achieve agreement on a single data value across nodes in a distributed system. Where it ensures consistency - where it maintains same copy among the network, accuracy and validates.
types:
pow - A consensus mechanism where miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.
pos - instead of working with computational power, here it works based on HOW much they are willing to stack.
dpos - Delegated Proof-of-Stake
poi - harvesting, vesting, transaction activity, transaction network, importance score
pbft (practical byzantine fault tolerance) - used in small organisation - 3 phases: pre-prepare, prepare, commit = 3m+1 total, 2m+1: fair
A consensus mechanism designed to tolerate malicious nodes, ensuring consensus as long as two-thirds of nodes are honest.
poet (proof of elapsed time) - Its a fair lottery system - each node shares certificate to intel sgx - then it receives a TIMER OBJ

public:
open to everyone, whoever want to participate
decentralised
maintains anomality  << ---
no permission needed
Ex: bitcoin, Ethereum
algo used: pow, pos

Private:
algo: pbft, poa
ex: Hyperledger


What is mining in cryptocurrencies?  << ----
The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain while earning rewards in the form of cryptocurrency.


blockheader contains:
previous block hash, timestamp, nounce, Merkel root, version, and difficulty target


HASH - block0 + data + nounce

hash chain maintains - Merkel tree

Cryptocurrency:
A digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography and built on blockchain technology.

How is Bitcoin different from Ethereum?  << ----
Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, while Ethereum is a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) with its own currency, Ether.

bitcoin:
first and most known cryptocurrency. uses peer to peer network and uses POW consensus algo to validate transaction.
Its also called as digital gold.

Ethereum:
known for enabling dApps and smart contracts.
It used Ethereum virtual machine to run contracts using solidity language.  << ----
public and decentralised
ERC-20: Standard for fungible tokens, where each unit is identical

Litecoin:
often called as "silver to bitcoin gold"
used for fast transactions times - higher supply.
used in payments, financial etc.

What is a hash function?
A cryptographic algorithm that converts input data into a fixed-size string, ensuring security and immutability.

How does blockchain address scalability issues?  << ---
Through solutions like sharding, Layer 2 protocols, and transitioning to PoS (e.g., Ethereum 2.0).


 
What is the role of gas fees in Ethereum?  << ---
Gas fees are transaction fees paid to miners for executing operations on the Ethereum blockchain.

What is double-spending?
The risk that digital currency can be spent more than once, prevented by blockchain's consensus mechanisms.


blockchain implementation steps:  << ----

define use case - pblm identification
choose blockchain type
design architecture
develop smart contracts
set up nodes and network
test and deploy
monitor and maintain
iterate and improve


assignment:

Implementing the PoW:

ganache - local Ethereum blockchain  << ----
web3 js 
solidity
react js
truffle - provides development env
meta mask - a cryptocurrency wallet and interact with Ethereum blockchain. - stores private key and help for transactions. << ----


two types of fork:
software fork: older versions still function, and no network split
hard fork: no compactible, split the blockchain


improvements in blockchains:

sha256 to sha 3
RSA to elliptical curve to improve speed


How bitcoin works ?!
Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money. 
creating a bitcoin wallet
make a transaction: transaction includes users public address, amount, and a digital signature created using your private key.
then transaction verification: It broadcasts through blockchain network.
Adding it in blockchain network.
Mining rewards
Transaction completion - receiver's wallet received the money.


Explain the concept of Merkle trees and their role in blockchain.
Merkle trees organize transaction data in a hierarchical structure using cryptographic hashes. They allow efficient and secure verification of transactions without requiring the entire blockchain.


What is the Longest Chain Rule in blockchain?  << ----
It is a rule in PoW where the chain with the most computational work (longest chain) is considered the valid blockchain.
